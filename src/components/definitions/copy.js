    body: `I'm a software engineer with strong previous experience in complex and consultative B2B software sales and implementation. \n I started my coding journey back in December of 2019 after four amazing years excelling in B2B software sales at HubSpot. Though I enjoyed my time in sales, I realized that instead of only selling the solution, I wanted to also develop deep technical expertise in software. So I took time to go on my own 'radical sabbatical' to relax, introspect, and see what direction I wanted to take in my career. \n After a ton of research, I decided to accelerate my learning by joining a coding bootcamp called Hack Reactor in NYC in mid 2020. Upon completion, I started my engineering journey as a  Customer Success Engineer at LeanIX in early 2021, but left in order to pursue a full stack engineering position. \n In mid 2022, I came across Twilio's Hatch Apprenticeship Program, decided to apply, and was selected as one of 8 software engineers out of 3,000+ applicants to be accepted into their rigorous 6 month apprenticeship. Unfortunately due to the wider macro-economic climate, though I formally received an "Exceeds Expectations" designation during my time as an apprentice, I was not able to be retained at the end of 2022. `,
