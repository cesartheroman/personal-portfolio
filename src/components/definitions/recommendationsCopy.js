    text: `I had the privilege of being Cesar's mentor while he was an Apprentice at Twilio. During our time together, I was able to see both his technical and personal growth. He was an engaged participant on our team, getting to know everyone on a personal level and bringing a spark of liveliness to our meetings. He was active in all of our ceremonies, surfaced questions with stakeholders, and helped to institute the concept of a Culture Captain on our team, effectively a point person whose responsibility it is to foster team bonding, an idea we've since spread to our at-large team.\n With regard to technical ability, Cesar is an ideal mix of self-sufficiency and a willingness to learn. He embraces the struggle to facilitate his own growth but is mindful of when he's out of his comfort zone and has no issue asking for help. His biggest task while at Twilio involved end-to-end feature work across several of our systems, from the API to a client-side application and a shared component library. In preparation for this work, he coordinated with stakeholders to gather requirements, communicated delays/blockers to the team, and facilitated the release and subsequent testing of his code changes across multiple realms. Exceeding expectations, he also converted an outdated piece of our API from JavaScript to TypeScript, something we expect from the rest of our team, and a task he was willing to take on, even though he was relatively unfamiliar with TypeScript at the time.\n While we weren't able to hold onto Cesar as part of our team, any company would be lucky to have him, not only for his technical potential as he grows in his career but largely because of the immeasurable intangibles he brings by just being himself. Go get 'em, Cesar!`,

    text: `I had the pleasure to work with Cesar during his time at Twilio and saw his exponential progress first hand as a software engineer. Goes without saying, changing careers when one is already well settled in a certain job is a bold decision. However, when I started working with Cesar it's easy to see how he has the capability to make big decisions and the sincerity and discipline to see it through.\n Cesars' work on Twilio Console Support application helped bring transparency and convenience in contacting Twilio support globally. He worked on building both UI and API, getting feedback from fellow developers, business leads, and made sure the solution we put in can stand the test of time. He achieved this by doing due diligence, connecting with other teams at Twilio, and seeking the truth for one of the data sources. Seeking the truth, being an owner, and continuously working on feedback are some of the most important traits of a software engineer and Cesar embodies all of them in plenty.\n I'm sure Cesar will be an asset to any organization he choses to work with, and has my highest recommendation.`,

I had the opportunity to be his co-new hire buddy and I can attest heâ€™s a positron, a team player, and a great asset to any team. His always learning attitude helps him complete any project he gets a chance to work with.\n His "Culture captain" idea to foster team connection and team morale was a great addition to the team and we'll make sure to carry it going forward. I would've loved to have him on our team long term.`,
